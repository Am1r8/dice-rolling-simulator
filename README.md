# dice-rolling-simulator

A very simple code for fun and for beginners.


this code will ask for dices you want to roll and then for how many times you want to roll and then it will start rolling it will ask for playing again when it rolls the first time it will not stop asking for roll time till you don't tell no/n.

It is very simple and easy to read code for beginners. I wrote this code between my class break. It takes less than 20 minutes and you can improve this by asking by player number and if you want to have a competitive match, you can do a lot of things with this.

license: you can use this for learning or for yourself but not for class or youtube video.
